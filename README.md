# Kaggle Competitions

### Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various Kaggle Competitions (past and ongoing). Some repositories are completed solutions, and some are in progress. Most of my solutions are in Python and R and specific to Data Science and Machine Learning problems in healthcare. 

#### Competitions

[Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression with Smartphone Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-parkinson-s-disease-progression-with-smartphone-data/data)

#### Data
My repositories do not contain the data for the project itself, however the data can be downloaded from the original Kaggle competitions directly.
